# SUMIF-and-PivotTable-with-VBA
An Excel workbook containing a few advanced functions.

This Excel workbook was created using Kaggle data about ecommerce sales / engagement data.

I created some advanced functions to analyse the data including a SUMIF sheet, a Pivot Table, as well as a VBA macro to automate the raw data cleanse process.

The VBA code can also be found in the file "VBA macro" within this repository.
